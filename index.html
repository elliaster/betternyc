			<h1>Reason for Existing</h1>
			<div>
				Living in a big city like New York can be amazing and a dream come true for some people. But along with the benefits of living here, there are some drawbacks. One of the main struggles that people have with living in New York City is the cost of rent. Most people live in apartments and have to pay rent to their landlords. It’s difficult for people to pay their rent on time, let alone the full amount. And due to landlords not being able to get their expected income, they have to raise the rent which would cause the tennant a harder time to pay everything towards the rent.

				Our idea, BetterNYC, is a service that would assist tenants by helping them pay their rent on time in the full amount. Here’s how it would work. BetterNYC would partner up with bank(s) that would provide credit cards that are linked with the BetterNYC services. Then we would use the credit cards to meet an agreement with the landlord of the apartments and have the tenants pay their rent with the card. When the tenants would pay the rent on time consistently, they would receive bonuses on their card that would help them pay the rent for the upcoming months. Like a reward system.
